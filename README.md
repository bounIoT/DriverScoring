# Driver Scoring

Our project deals with coming up with a scoring system for drivers especially those of public transportation. Using a 3-axis accelerometer, we measure accelerations of X, Y and Z axis and calculate a score based on EN 12299 regulation.

In our project we use Arduino Yun and Adafruit 10 DOF IMU's LSM303DLHC accelerometer module. We send our data via Wi-Fi, using MQTT, to IBM's cloud service Bluemix and display the result with Node-RED.
