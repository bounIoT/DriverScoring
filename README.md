# Problem Definition
Passengers who use public transportation has a right to have a safe and convenient drive but there are negligent drivers who cause risk and discomfort to traffic and passengers. There’s no portable and autonomous measuring device for continuous and objective on-board comfort measurements on local transport buses. Without any supervision, this problem will continue to arise. 

# Problem Solution
We gather the data by using Arduino Yun and Adafruit 10 DOF IMU's LSM303DLHC accelerometer module. We send our data via Wi-Fi, using MQTT, to IBM's cloud service Bluemix and display the result with Node-RED. These data are processed according to a passenger comfort index in EN 12299 regulation. The end of these process reporting driver scores over time.
